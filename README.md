**task1** 

This program receives the number 1 or 2 from the console and, depending on this, implements the logic:
- if the number 1 is entered into the console: the string is received from the console, reversed and entered on the 
screen;
- if the number 2 is entered into the console: the number is received from the console and its factorial is displayed 
on the screen.

A generalized functional interface "MyFuncInterface" is used to operate the program.

**task2**

This program receives a date from the console in the format "dd/MM/yyyy" and displays the day of the week for this date.
